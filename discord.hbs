                        don't get me wrong! We try our best to be a safe space and as far as I've seen, am doing
                        anywhere from pretty to really good with that.
                        People here are fun and I have made lots of friends I would not have gotten the opportunity to
                        meet otherwise. You're gonna have a great time here (if you plan on being respectful and stuff,
                        that is).

                        The people were kind, friendly, and welcoming, and the owner is one of the nicest, most down to
                        earth peeps you'd ever meet.
                        I definitely think this server deserves the best possible rating.</p>
